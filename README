USAGE

================================

/functions
	Add this directory to your theme, or copy the directory contents to your theme's /functions directory if it already exists.

functions.php
	Add these declarations to your theme's functions.php file. Set the Twitter Username and adjust the set_post_thumbnail size as needed.

/images/sharebox
	Copy this directory to your theme's /images directory.

/styles/sharebox.css
	Add or @import the styles to your stylesheet.


Place <?php jg_sharebox(); ?> wherever you want the sharebox to appear.
	-	If you are using WordPress Comments and want to show the comment count: jg_sharebox(1);
	-	If you are using Facebook Comments but still want a link to the comments area of the page: jg_sharebox(2, 'comments'); where "comments" is the ID of the DIV tag surrounding the comments area.
	-	If the content area has relative positioning, the script that reveals and animates the tooltip misfires. To remove the script: jg_sharebox( 0, '', false ); . Be sure to adjust the styles in sharebox.css according to the instructions in that file.


Example:

<?php jg_sharebox( 0, '', false ); ?>
	Will show no comments, no comment tag, and no script will be included.

<?php jg_sharebox( 2, 'comments' ); ?>
	Will show a link with words "Post a Comment" and link to the "comments" DIV tag.
